# Equitable Resilience Builder

## Introduction
The Equitable Resilience Builder (ERB) is an application that supports communities in resilience planning with a focus on equity. It engages users in a guided process to inclusively assess local hazards, equity, and the resilience of built, natural, and social environment systems. It is intended to be used by a core team that could include local government and community organizations. The ERB is organized into five sections: plan, engage, assess, strategize action, and move forward. Results can be used to collaboratively prioritize actions to build community resilience to disasters and climate change in an equitable way.
