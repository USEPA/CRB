# Community Resilience Builder

## Introduction
The Community Resilience Builder (CRB) is a decision-support tool for communities carrying out resilience planning. The application engages users in a guided process to assess local hazards and the resilience of built, natural, and social environment systems. It is intended to be used by a core team that could include local government and community organizations. The CRB is organized into five sections: plan, engage, assess, strategize action, and move forward. Results can be used to collaboratively prioritize actions to build community resilience to disasters.
