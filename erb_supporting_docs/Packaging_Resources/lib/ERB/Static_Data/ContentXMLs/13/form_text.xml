			text="WHY: Indicators are measures of the condition of a system. Some indicators are easy to interpret—a warning light going on in a car is a sign it needs to be taken to a repair shop. Indicators of community resilience are harder to interpret. In ERB, sorting indicator cards is a participatory process. It incorporates multiple perspectives in interpreting where your community is doing well already in being able to deal with disasters and climate change, and where to focus efforts on strengthening resilience in an equitable way.">

			text="HOW: The core team has already collected data to measure the indicator (if they decided to gather additional data) and has input this information into ERB. Sorting indicator cards is done in a workshop setting. It can be done in two ways, offline and within the ERB tool. Both ways sort the indicators into an Indicator Diagram based on how resilient and how equitable participants think the indicators show your community to be.">
