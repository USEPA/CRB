The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2021 Policy on Children's Health defines children from conception, infancy, early childhood, and through adolescence until 21 years of age ​[2]​ . However, different stages of childhood have different needs and youth engagement strategies need to be age appropriate. This guide is intended to facilitate engagement of older children, approximately ages 12 to 21, and uses &quot;children&quot; and &quot;youth&quot; interchangeably.">

			text="Children are especially vulnerable to the world around them. Due to factors such as unique physiology, limited ability to cope with stress, dependence on adults, lack of political or economic influence, and an underdeveloped metabolism and immune system, children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of hazards and disasters. They experience multiple forms of vulnerability including physical, psychological/emotional, and educational (Figure 1). Physically, youth experience higher rates of injury and death from disasters ​[3]​. When displaced and/or facing homelessness, children are at a higher risk for physical and sexual violence ​[4]​.  Further, due to physiological factors such as a developing immune system and lower body fluid, children and youth are more susceptible to acute illnesses, disease outbreaks, cold and heat stress, dehydration, malnutrition, and more ​[5]​. With developing organs, metabolisms and immune systems, they are also more sensitive to toxic chemicals that can result from hazards and disasters such as sewage, chemical and oil releases, asbestos, and black mold​[6]​. Children eat more, drink more, and breathe more in proportion to their body size than adults, which can lead to higher exposures to these toxics.">

			text="Due to a more limited ability to process trauma, youth experiencing hazards and disasters are also more susceptible to emotional and psychological disorders and distress, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, behavioral issues, and trouble sleeping ​[3], [5]​. Hazards and disasters can disrupt students’ education by damaging school buildings, causing teacher shortages, and displacing students and teachers. As a result, youth often miss days of school, move around to different schools, and/or drop out of school entirely. These factors, in combination with emotional trauma from disasters and individual risk factors, lead to hindered academic performance, inhibited cognitive function, and delayed social development​ [3], [5], [6]​.

Participation benefits youth by improving cognitive, social, and emotional development, promoting a sense of empowerment, and reducing marginalization ​[7], [8]​. Further, children have many strengths to contribute to resilience and recovery planning. For instance, they are skilled at organizing and advocating, they can translate and mediate between generations, they can raise awareness in their community and with peers (e.g., via social media), they can be first responders, and much more ​[9]​. Finally, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child ​[10]​, children and youth have a right to participate in hazard and disaster planning. Despite these factors, they are often viewed as passive victims and excluded from planning and emergency preparedness processes.">

			text="Meaningful participation is essential for successfully engaging youth in hazard and disaster resilience planning. Roger Hart described a ladder of child participation in a 1992 essay (Figure 2) ​[11]​. Meaningful participation goes beyond simply inviting youth to a meeting — it involves actively engaging youth and ensuring that their input and voices are heard. Allowing youth to lead or co-lead discussions and activities fosters the highest levels of participation. Consulting with youth and/or informing youth also fall under meaningful participation, though lower in the hierarchy. It is critical to avoid unethical and tokenistic participation. Examples of this include manipulating youth, not valuing and acting on the views expressed by youth, or not allowing youth to express their views in the first place. ">

			text="Meaningful youth engagement also requires addressing &quot;adultism&quot;. Adults often view children as passive and helpless, which leads them to exclude children from discussing topics that are deemed difficult, complex, or potentially harmful [12]. Some adults might also believe that including children in decision making processes threatens the adults’ authority. Research demonstrates that resistance from adults is a major barrier to child and youth participation, but working in partnership with children can positively change the way adults view them [4]. Adults must actively work to overcome their implicit or explicit bias(es) towards children by centering youth voices and recognizing their rights to participate [9].">

Children’s intersecting identities and social location (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, social class, ability, geography, resources, legal status, immigration status, and housing status) will impact their vulnerability to hazards and disasters. Planning for equitable resilience requires intentional recruitment of youth from diverse backgrounds, especially harder-to-reach youth. While it is important to utilize existing structures to recruit youth, such as school clubs and community youth organizations, marginalized youth might not have the opportunity for youth leadership positions or membership in established youth groups and clubs.">

These activities can allow youth to demonstrate their expertise and take more ownership of the process. They also allow children to be creative and have fun, keeping them engaged.

Youth participation can occur on many levels and engagement activities can be tailored to specific needs and interests.
