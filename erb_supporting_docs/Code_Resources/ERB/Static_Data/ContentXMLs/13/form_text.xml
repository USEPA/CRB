			text="WHY: Indicators are measures of the condition of a system. Some indicators are easy to interpret—a warning light going on in a car is a sign it needs to be taken to a repair shop. Indicators of community resilience are harder to interpret. In ERB, sorting indicator cards is a participatory process. It incorporates multiple perspectives in interpreting where your community is doing well already in being able to deal with disasters and climate change, and where to focus efforts on strengthening resilience in an equitable way.">

			text="HOW: The core team has already collected data to measure the indicator (if they decided to gather additional data) and has input this information into ERB. Sorting indicator cards is done in a workshop setting. It can be done in two ways, offline and within the ERB tool. Both ways sort the indicators into a quadrant diagram based on how resilient and how equitable participants think the indicators show your community to be.">

			text="To sort cards offline, print out cards for the indicators you’ve chosen using the Indicator Card template. In the workshop, participants sort the indicators using a resilience axis and an equity axis to create the quadrant diagram. See details in the Workshop 2 Facilitators Guide and Indicator Activity Instructions in the Worksheet Index. After the workshop, you can take photos of quadrant diagram(s) and save them in ERB using Upload File.">

			text="To sort cards within the ERB tool, use the Indicators Board page in the Assess section. Click on dropdown boxes to select the indicators you will use, then click Begin. On the next page, drag-and-drop indicator cards in the gray box, ordering them from least to most resilient. Click the Next button. On the next page, drag-and-drop each card into the grey boxes, ordering them from least to most equitable. This creates a quadrant visualization. Click the “Push to My Portfolio” button to save your final ranking. See the Indicator Activity Instructions for more details.">
